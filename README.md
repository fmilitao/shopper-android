# shopper-android

Broken stuff and ugly code. This project is just to experiment with Android development.

Will eventually be a usable shopping list app, maybe.

Tasks:

- [x] basic activity layout and functionality
- [ ] fix animations and auto-sorting
- [ ] switch to using SQLite for persistent stuff
- [ ] suggest words as they are typed?

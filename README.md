# shopper-android

Broken stuff and ugly code. This project is just to experiment with Android development.

Will eventually be a usable shopping list app, maybe.

Tasks:

- [x] basic activity layout and functionality
- [x] fix animations and auto-sorting, refactor code instead of current mess.
- [x] animation between activities, transition left/right
- [ ] add swipe to delete?
- [ ] switch to using SQLite for persistent stuff
- [ ] fix double tap on any button.
